# Smart_Pharmacy

## This is a project for robotic pharmacy.
the robot works from the phone with a Bluetooth connection.
the user chooses the drug name from the dashboard on the phone and the stepper motors move the axes until to reach the drug that the user had entered then the servo motor moves the drug to the window so that the user can take it.
